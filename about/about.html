            <p>
                I'm an Edmonton based full time student and aspiring software developer. In my previous life I started a career in the
                music industry as a guitar player and transitioned to Live Sound Engineering. After a decade of music industry work I
                decided my skillset could be diversified, and the technical portion of audio was always the one that interested me the most.
                Based on my interests Computer Engineering seemed like the obvious choice in terms of a new career path. In my free time I am a 
                proud dad of two dogs, I still play music constantly, and I'm also an avid basketball fanatic. I'm looking forward to starting 
                my new career path and I am open to any opportunities that come my way.
            </p>
